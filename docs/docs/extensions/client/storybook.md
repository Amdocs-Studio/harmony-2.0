# Storybook

Harmony includes Storybook built-in, providing a powerful tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation. Storybook allows you to create and showcase components independently, making it easier to develop, test, and document your UI.

## Benefits of Using Storybook in Harmony

- **Isolated Development**: Develop components in isolation without running your entire application.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Create interactive documentation for your components, making it easier for other developers to understand and use them.
- **Visual Testing**: Visually test components to ensure they look and behave as expected.
- **Component Libraries**: Build and maintain a library of reusable components.
- **Integration with Testing Tools**: Integrate with various testing tools to automate visual regression testing.

## Getting Started with Storybook

To get started with Storybook in Harmony, follow these steps:

1. **Install Storybook**: Storybook is included in Harmony, so you don't need to install it separately.
2. **Create Stories**: Create stories for your components to showcase different states and variations.
3. **Run Storybook**: Use the command `npm run storybook` to start the Storybook server and view your components in the browser.

## Creating Stories

Each time you create a component, you can also generate a story for it. This allows you to document and test the component in isolation.

### Example Story

```typescript
// MyComponent.stories.ts
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentStory, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

export default {
  title: 'Components/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
} as Meta;

const Template: ComponentStory<typeof MyComponent> = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  // Add default args here
};

```

### Advanced Storybook Features
Storybook offers a range of advanced features to enhance your development workflow:


- **Addons**: Extend Storybook's functionality with addons for accessibility, actions, backgrounds, controls, and more.
- **Docs**: Automatically generate documentation for your components using the @storybook/addon-docs addon.
- **Controls**: Create interactive controls for your component props to dynamically change their values in the Storybook UI.
- **Actions**: Log actions and events triggered by your components to debug and test their behavior.
