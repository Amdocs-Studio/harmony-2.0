## Harmony 2.0

Harmony Boilerplate2.0  gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production based react redux: react routers & mobile rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, Redux TK, and more. No config needed.
######  This project was inspired by [harmony](https://github.com/harmony-framework/harmony-boilerplate), but most of the technologies are different and the project is built from scratch.

## Speeds up development
We did most of the heavy lifting for you to provide a better experience with boilerplates.


## Best Practice
Predefined scripts that let you deliver your app as fast as you can.


## Static-Typing
The boilerplate comes with Typescript built-in provided with pre-defined rule-set for better writing and predective bad practices.


## Real-Time Dispatching
Ability to dispatch actions on each client via Websockets.


## User Authentication

## Multilingual Support
Easy to add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.
