# Harmony 2.0

Harmony 2.0 gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production based react redux: react routers & mobile rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, Redux TK, and more. No config needed.
######  This project was inspired by [harmony-framework](https://github.com/harmony-framework/harmony-boilerplate), but most of the technologies are different and the project is built from scratch.

Harmony is a starter-kit to enable fast on-boarding when it comes to developing web applications with the focus on React Redux and NodeJS.
Harmony suggest new features and improve your flexibility by adding your customized features.
